## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to help me gain experience with simulating semiconductor device behaviours.
Current simulations include:
- **1D and 2D capacitors**
- **PN junction**

- `devsim/`  
    Contains necessary DEVSIM installations

- `simulations/`  
    Jupyter notebooks containing simulations

- `utilities/`  
    Utilities for parsing mesh files (e.g., `.msh`) and simulation output.

- `docs/`  
    Detailed write-ups, mathematical background, and methodology for some simulations.
